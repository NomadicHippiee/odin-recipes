# odin-recipes
Recipes challenges from The Odin Project. 

In this challenge I will set up an basic HTML page that shows food recipies. 

The recipes and pictures on this site is generated with Gemini. AI is only used for picture and text generating, not for the code itself. 

For the HOME button I found inspiration from this site: https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples
