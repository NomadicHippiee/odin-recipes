        <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 pre-made pizza crust</strong> (store-bought, about 10-12 inches)</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup pizza sauce</strong> (canned or jarred)</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1/4 cup sliced pepperoni</strong> (or your favorite toppings like mushrooms, peppers, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong> (optional, for brushing crust)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat and Prep:</strong> Preheat your oven to <strong>425°F (220°C).</strong> Place the pre-made pizza crust on
                a baking sheet or a pizza stone. If desired, lightly brush the edges of the crust with <strong>1 tablespoon of
                olive oil</strong> for extra crispiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauce it Up:</strong> Spoon the <strong>1/2 cup of pizza sauce</strong> onto the center of the crust. Use the
                back of the spoon to spread the sauce evenly, leaving about a 1/2-inch border for the crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Season and Cheese:</strong> Sprinkle the entire sauced area with the <strong>1/2 teaspoon of dried
                Italian seasoning.</strong> Next, evenly distribute the <strong>1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese</strong> over the sauce.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Scatter the <strong>1/4 cup of sliced pepperoni</strong> (or your chosen toppings)
                across the top of the cheese. Make sure they are evenly spread for consistent cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Carefully place the baking sheet or pizza stone into the preheated oven. Bake for
                <strong>10-15 minutes,</strong> or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for <strong>3-5 minutes</strong> before
                slicing. This helps the cheese set. Slice the pizza and enjoy!</li>
