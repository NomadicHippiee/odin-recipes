        <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 pound (approx. 450g) lean ground beef</strong> (or ground turkey/plant-based crumbles)</li>
            <li><strong>1 packet (approx. 1 oz / 28g) taco seasoning mix</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 head of romaine lettuce,</strong> washed and chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 cup crushed tortilla chips</strong> (or a few handfuls of whole chips)</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup salsa</strong> (your favorite kind)</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup sour cream</strong> (or Greek yogurt, optional for topping)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the Meat:</strong>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef (or your choice of meat) over
                medium heat until it is fully browned. Drain off any excess fat.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Season the Meat:</strong>Stir in the <strong>taco seasoning mix</strong> and 2/3 cup of water. Bring the mixture
                to a simmer, then reduce the heat and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the liquid has mostly absorbed,
                stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Base:</strong>In a large bowl, combine the <strong>chopped romaine lettuce</strong> to create the
                salad base.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Salad:</strong>Add the cooled, seasoned <strong>taco meat</strong> over the lettuce. Top with the
                shredded cheese and the salsa.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add the Crunch:</strong>Just before serving, sprinkle the <strong>crushed tortilla chips</strong> over the top of
                the salad for that essential taco shell crunch.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve and Finish:</strong>Divide the salad into individual bowls. Dollop each serving with a
                spoonful of <strong>sour cream</strong> (if using) and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
